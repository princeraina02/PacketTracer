"Dynamic Routing Configuration with RIP Protocol: Multi-Router Setup in Cisco Packet Tracer"

Explore dynamic routing protocols with this Cisco Packet Tracer project, featuring the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) across five interconnected routers. Witness routers autonomously updating routing tables to adapt to network changes. Each router participates in RIP, facilitating efficient route dissemination. Delve into RIP configuration parameters, including network addresses, hop counts, and routing updates. Whether you're new to routing protocols or seeking deeper insights, this project offers a comprehensive exploration of RIP in action. Analyze routing tables and experience the dynamic nature of network communication in a simulated environment.
