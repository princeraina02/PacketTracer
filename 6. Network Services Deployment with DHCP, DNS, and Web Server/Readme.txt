"Network Services Deployment with DHCP, DNS, and Web Server: Multi-Router Setup in Cisco Packet Tracer"

Embark on a comprehensive networking journey with this Cisco Packet Tracer project, designed to showcase the deployment of essential network services across a network spanning two routers. Experience the seamless operation of DHCP, DNS, and a web server as they play pivotal roles in ensuring network connectivity, name resolution, and web hosting capabilities. In this simulation, two routers facilitate the interconnection of multiple devices, including DHCP clients, DNS resolvers, and web clients accessing the hosted website. Delve into the configuration of DHCP scopes, DNS zones, and web server settings to provide dynamic IP addressing, domain name resolution, and web content delivery. Whether you're a budding network administrator or an experienced IT professional, this project offers a hands-on opportunity to deploy and manage critical network services, fostering a deeper understanding of their functionalities and interdependencies.
