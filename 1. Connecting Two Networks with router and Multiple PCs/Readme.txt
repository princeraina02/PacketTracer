"Simple Network Configuration with Cisco Packet Tracer: Connecting Two Networks with router and Multiple PCs"

Delve into the fundamentals of network configuration with this project created using Cisco Packet Tracer. In this simulation, a single router acts as the backbone, connecting two distinct networks. With one side hosting a network of five PCs and the other side accommodating a separate network of one PC, this setup illustrates the basics of subnetting, routing, and interconnecting networks. Whether you're a novice seeking hands-on experience or a seasoned professional brushing up on networking essentials, this project provides a practical demonstration of network segmentation and connectivity. Explore the project files to gain insights into IP addressing, subnet masks, routing tables, and more, and expand your networking repertoire with this engaging simulation.
